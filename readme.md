# Awesome Chatbot!

Hey there! Looking to make a chatbot? Here is your right place!

These are the steps to make YOUR (own!!!) chatbot using Node JS

Step 1 -
First, fork this repository, then clone that repository from repl.it.
Step 2 - 
Once your repl is ready, check your sidebar and see a lock sign. There, you should put "token" as your key, and as value, your bot token.

Step 3 -
Add your bot customisations in index.js and chatSend.js, when requiring clever-chat

Step 4 -
Add your name in `owner = ""` in the index.js and `prefix = ""`

Step 5 -
Go to your "SHELL" in your right, and copy/paste run this command -
`npm i axios@0.21.1 chalk@4.1.1 clever-chat@8.0.0 discord.js@12.5.3 dotenv@10.0.0 express@4.17.1 quick.db@7.1.3`

Step 6 -
Go to "index.js" file and click on "RUN" in repl.it
Now, it should show your bot is online!!

Now, if you see your bot is online, or "streaming" mode as I set it to, run the command `{your bot prefix here}setchat #some-channel-name-here`
Go to that channel, and say Hi, and have a lovely chat!

You can also chat with the bot in DMs!
